Automated Support for Battle Operational-Strategic Decision-Making

This repository reports the empirical validation of the framework in the Battle of Crete, Iwo Jima and Kursk, the key to test the framework proposed in the thesis "Automated Support for Battle Operational-Strategic Decision-Makin" developed at the Department of Computer Systems and Software Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), 28040 Madrid, Spain.

In particular, on the Battle of Crete and Iwo-Jima, our validation goal is to identify the best possible courses of action according to current doctrine and determine the effects they produce on the adversary in comparison with the actual battles on 20 May 1941 and 19 February 1945, on the Kursk battle, our goal is the correct identification of the battle phases by dynamically adjust from adaptive and predictive control.

All of them were developed using excel spreadsheets through Microsoft Excel 2016. The following Excel plug-ins have also been used; EZAnalyze v3.0, XLSTAT 2021 v1.4, and Simple Decision Tree v1.4.

In the excel spreadsheets, you will find tables defining the events of the battle based on the attrition values, the method used in the prediction of the values is the non-linear GRG algorithm and Markovian Lanchesterian approximation.

There have been included the setpoints for the different battles.
